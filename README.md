# Desne

Desne is a game where you can simulate realistic actions of nations and states
on a randomly generated map.

## Installation

To install, go to the [releases](https://github.com/M0sh1M00/Desne/releases)
page and download a version of Desne that suits you. Once downloaded, unzip the file and execute `Desne.py` using Python 3. Remember that you have to run the Python file in the same folder as the resources for it to work.

Versions ending with `_opt` are optimised to run really fast, but do not contain
all the featurs of a regular release like sound FX and music.
